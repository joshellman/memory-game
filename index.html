    <h1> SAFARI MEMORY GAME</h1>
<!-- <h2>(Work In Progress...)</h2> -->

<!-- For now, if you click on two matching cards, then the pair of cards will remain facing up. If you choose two different cards that do not match, the cards will turn back over after 1 second -->

<h4>Player 1 Score</h4>
<h4>Player 2 Score</h4>

  <!--TO BE BUILT: -->

    <!-- Eventually the game will shuffle the cards, have a button to start the game for two players. Each player's score will depend on the amount of time and number of clicks needed to complete the game. Whoever has the better score will be the winner -->
